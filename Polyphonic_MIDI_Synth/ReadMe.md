#Polyphoneic MIDI Synth

Demo video: https://youtu.be/dB4cgWcmwUU

I set out to iterate on my previous synthesizer  
by adding more tone colors, and expanding the GUI  
to include a keyboard element. The tone colors  
represent different multipliers for the FM modulator  
frequency. I had also hoped to implement a tremolo  
effect by modulating the index depth in a sinusoidal  
manner (I was not able to get this far).

My first step was to get the synthesizer working  
and accepting MIDI information as a stand-alone  
application (successfully accomplished this). Then,  
I built a basic AU plug-in and successfully integrated  
it into an Ardour project. Where I ran into trouble was  
combining the two projects. I'm still trying to figure  
out these bugs, and will come back to this project in  
the future.

# Audio_FX_Plugins

Audio effects plugins for use in a variety of DAWs,  
built on top of the popular JUCE framework.

Most of these applications were designed as part  
of coursework for MUSIC 256 at Stanford University's  
CCRMA facility.  Many began as templates designed by  
Romain Michon that were modified to fulfill assignment  
specifications.

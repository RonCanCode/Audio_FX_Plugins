# FM_Synth

Demo video: https://youtu.be/kQImLhBoVNc

This current version has a GUI, fully functional synth,  
three "tone colors", and adjustable "depth" parameter.  

The next version will include keystoke control of notes,  
and a "speed" parameter. This parameter will controll the  
rate at which "depth" is oscillated within a set range  
(+/- 0.25*Depth oscillating about 0.5*Depth).  The "speed"  
will range from ~1Hz up to 50Hz.  This same modulator will  
also be scaled down, and coupled to "gain", thus completing  
the tremolo effect.
